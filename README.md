# FifthProject-Amusument-Park-Pass-Generator-Part-2
**Description:** 
For Part 2, which is Project 5, you will construct the User Interface element and workflow. They are shown in the project mockups and Onward and Upward Instruction Video. You will also add features like data entry screen and pass generation. In addition, several additional types of entrants such as contracted employees, vendors, season pass holders and senior guests, will be added. Keep in mind that youâ€™ll want to write the code for Part I so it can be reused and extended in Part 2. (You will probably need to refactor some code, regardless, but do keep this in mind.)
